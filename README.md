Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. It allows two players to play the game in a console-based interface.

Features

- Two-player mode**: Player 1 and Player 2 take turns to place their markers ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 board.
- Input validation**: Ensures players enter valid slot numbers and do not place markers on already occupied slots.
- Winner detection**: Checks for a winner after each move by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Tie detection**: Declares a tie if all slots are filled without a winner.

How to Play

1. The game prompts Player 1 to choose their marker ('X' or 'O').
2. Players take turns entering the slot number (1-9) where they want to place their marker.
3. The game displays the updated board after each move.
4. The game announces the winner if a player gets three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal, or declares a tie if all slots are filled.
